-- Background --

   Farsi  (Or  sometimes  referred  to  as  Persian) is the Language of us;
Iranians  (also  sometimes  called  Persians).  This Language has character
shapes other than Latin.  It has 32 alphabets that 26 of them are in common
with Arabic.  The number shapes are alike in most digits and can be used in
place of each other.

   Each  alphabet,  unlike Latin and Roman, may has several shapes, related
to  position  in  the  word.  Some has just one shape, and some has up to 4
shapes.   this  multi-shape characters make about 150 characters if we want
to  build all the exact forms.  Cause of such a big problem, the characters
shapes is reduced in normal DOS-Type screens.  There are some standards for
both  character  map  and  and  their position in ASCII table, but the most
popular standard is called IranSystem (made by IranSystem company).

   The   second   matter   is   direction.   Farsi  caligarphy  is  written
right-to-left  and the numbers are written left-to-right just like english.
Arabic  numbers are both written and read reversely, although the number is
seen as english and Farsi.

-- What it Does --

    Vegaf does 2 things.  It gets resident in the system and:

   1) Changes +128 ASCII characters to Farsi characters.

   2) Makes a hotkey to change  output  Farsi or English, enabling to type
      both languages simultaneuosly.  If you have run the program, you can
      read any normal or bilingual text,  but if your  text  contains some
      special characters (like checkmark),  you can't see the correct form.

-- How to use --

   Normally  people run it at startup, maybe in autoexec.  you can also run
whenever you need, at DOS prompt.  Copy the command where you like and then
call  it when needed.  This version is a one time resident program and this
means that if you run it more than one time, no problem will be occured.

   After  running  the program nothing visually happens.  Normal DOS prompt
will  be work.  When you want to write Farsi, you have to press Scroll_Lock
key on your keyboard and repressing it will enable the English typing.

   In any text editor you can do the same for Farsi typing.

-- Important --

   To  prevent  user  to  remember  all  the char forms and also because of
limited  keyboard  keys  for  all  the possible characters, this program is
designed  intelligent.   It  can  recognise when it has to use first-shape,
middle or end-shape of character.

   This  is  not  a  difficult  process, program types first shape when you
press  a  key,  then  watches what is the next char and corrects char while
writing  the next char.  end-chars normally take shape when you press space
to  separate  word from the next word, or when you press one of Comma, Dot,
Qout, ...

   If  you  want  to  write  a,  small  or continused character that is not
attached to any word, simply type the char and then move using cursor keys.
