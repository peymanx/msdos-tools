    my local drive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

Why does the FoxPro installation sometimes stop before allowing the 
installation of optional components?

Answer 1

Sometimes in low memory conditions the installation program is unable
to determine whether to run the standard (FOXPRO.EXE) or the enhanced
(FOXPROX.EXE) version to complete the installation.  If you're
installing from within Windows, you can exit Windows to make more memory
available.  If you have any TSR programs running, removing them may free
additional memory.  For information on subsequently installing optional
components see Question 2 in this section.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

How do I install additional files that I did not specify during 
installation?

Answer 2

Restart FoxPro by typing FOX at the MS-DOS prompt and pressing Enter.  
Insert any one of the product disks into the floppy drive and enter the 
following command in the FoxPro Command window:

DO INSTALL

You will be prompted to insert the disk or disks that contain the 
additional files you want to install.  If you are attempting to install 
from a drive other than drive A, you will be instructed to select 
another source drive after the "Abort, Retry, Fail?" message.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3

Why does FoxPro reboot during the installation process?

Answer 3

You could have an anti-virus program running or an old video driver. 
Try using a different video driver (for example, VGA.DRV from Windows)
and running with a clean CONFIG.SYS file and AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4

How does SMARTDRV affect FoxPro performance?

Answer 4

You may notice a substantial reduction in performance when SMARTDRV is 
loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file.  In particular, the /DOUBLE_BUFFER switch 
seems to adversely affect performance.  This performance degradation 
does not seem to occur when SMARTDRV is loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
Some systems, however, require SMARTDRV to be loaded in CONFIG.SYS for 
compatibility.  For example, when using a permanent swap file on a SCSI 
drive, SMARTDRV must be loaded in CONFIG.SYS to allow Microsoft Windows 
to load.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5

What BUFFERS and FILES statements are appropriate for FoxPro for MS-DOS?

Answer 5

For best performance with FoxPro when SMARTDRV is loaded, set buffers to 
10 in the CONFIG.SYS file.  Anything more is redundant, taking valuable 
memory that FoxPro could use for processing.

If you do not use a disk cache program such as SMARTDRV, you should 
allocate enough MS-DOS buffers to hold all of the directory entries in 
the subdirectory where you will be working.  Forty buffers is usually 
sufficient as long as the number of files in a subdirectory remains 
below 250.

The FILES statement should always be at least 10 more than the greatest 
number of files that you will have open at one time.  We recommend a 
minimum of 40.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6

Does FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS operate with the DOS Protected Mode Interface 
(DPMI)?

Answer 6

Yes.  FoxPro 2.5 works with DPMI-compliant memory managers, such as 
Microsoft Windows.  If you use a DPMI memory manager, you can control 
the physical memory that FoxPro uses by specifying the MEMLIMIT option 
in your CONFIG.FP file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7

What factors influence FoxPro startup speed?

Answer 7

The time required to load and start FoxPro relates to the physical size 
of FoxPro, the length of the PATH in effect, the number of items that 
must be sought at startup, and other factors.  Many of these items are 
under your control.  For a complete discussion of this issues refer to 
the section on Optimizing Your System in the Installation and 
Configuration manual.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8

I am receiving the error message "TOO MANY FILES OPEN." How can I 
correct this problem?

Answer 8

If you receive this error message, use one or more of the following 
strategies:

* Increase the FILES setting in the CONFIG.SYS file.
* If you are using a Novell network, increase the FILE HANDLES setting 
  in the SHELL.CFG file.
* If you are using SHARE, increase the number of files and locks.  (For 
  example, you could use SHARE  /F: 4096  /L:500)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 9

The Standard Version of FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS runs correctly, but when I 
load the Extended Version, I receive the error message "INCOMPATIBLE 
MEMORY MANAGER."  What is causing this problem?

Answer 9

When you configure your memory manager, verify that you allow it to 
create expanded memory. Please refer to the "Optimizing Your System" 
section in the Developer's Guide for further information on the Extended 
Version of FoxPro.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 10

I am receiving the error message "RUN COMMAND FAILED." How can I correct 
this problem?

Answer 10

This error is caused by one of the following conditions:

FoxPro cannot find the COMMAND.COM file. Use the SHELL equal sign 
statement with the forward slash P parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file to 
specify the location of the COMMAND.COM file.

or

If the location of COMMAND.COM is already specified, FoxPro does not 
have enough conventional memory to execute the command. If this is the 
case, use FoxSwap to execute the command. (For example, use RUN /0 DIR 
instead of RUN DIR).  RUN /0 automatically makes all available 
conventional memory accessible.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 11

Why do I have several files with the extension .TMP on my disk?

Answer 11

Every time you load FoxPro, it creates temporary (.TMP) files. These 
files are automatically deleted when you exit FoxPro with a normal 
shutdown. However, .TMP files still exist if you reboot the machine from 
within FoxPro, or if you don't have delete rights in the directory where 
the files reside. Exit FoxPro and acquire the rights to delete all these 
files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 12

When I try to start up a second instance of FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS within 
Windows, I get the error "Cannot access file at this time ...".  This 
only happens when the version of FoxPro resides on my local drive.

Answer 12

This appears to be caused by a problem with SHARE.  Current workarounds 
include marking the FoxPro executable READONLY, running under Windows 
for Workgroups or running a copy of FoxPro from a network location.

Network Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

1   When a second user enters Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS on my network, 
    the error message "FILE IN USE BY ANOTHER" is displayed. How can I 
    correct this problem?
2   In a network environment, where does FoxPro create its temporary 
    files?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

When a second user enters Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS on my network, the 
error message "FILE IN USE BY ANOTHER" is displayed. How can I correct 
this problem?

Answer 1

If you are on a peer-to-peer network, you must first load MS-DOS SHARE 
and then verify that the FoxPro files are marked as read only. The 
FOXUSER database can be shared only if the file is marked "R-O" (read 
only). If you receive this error message when you try to open a database 
file, make sure that both users have EXCLUSIVE set to OFF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

In a network environment, where does FoxPro create its temporary files?

Answer 2

FoxPro creates its temporary files in the current working directory 
unless you specifically designate an alternate location by including one 
or more of the EDITWORK, SORTWORK, PROGWORK and/or TMPFILES statements 
in the CONFIG.FP file.

If local workstations have sizable hard drives with plenty of free 
space, you can improve performance in the multi-user environment by 
placing FoxPro temporary work files on the local drive or on a RAM 
drive.  Redirecting these files to a local drive or a RAM drive 
provides additional speed by reducing the need to access the network 
drive and, therefore, reducing the amount of network traffic.

On small networks with older workstations with slow hard drives, we have 
occasionally experienced better performance by leaving FoxPro temporary 
files on the file server.  When in doubt, direct temporary files to the 
local hard drive.

Converting from FoxPro 2.0 to FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

1   Are my existing FoxPro 2.0 screens and reports compatible with 
    FoxPro 2.5?
2   What about existing library files created with the FoxPro 2.0 
    Library Construction Kit?  Can these be used in FoxPro 2.5?
3   I have some existing programs compiled under FoxPro 2.0.  Are they 
    compatible?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

Are my existing FoxPro 2.0 screens and reports compatible with FoxPro 2.5?

Answer 1

The structures of the databases created by the power tools have changed 
in FoxPro 2.5  When you first open files of these types, FoxPro 2.5 
converts them to FoxPro 2.5 format (with your permission).  This 
conversion is a one-way process -- files that have been converted to 2.5 
formats may no longer be opened in 2.0.  You may want to make backups 
before converting.  For more information about specific FoxPro 2.5 file 
formats, see the Tables chapter in the Update manual.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

What about existing library files created with the FoxPro 2.0 Library 
Construction Kit?  Can these be used in FoxPro 2.5?

Answer 2

Library files created with the FoxPro 2.0 Library Construction Kit must 
be relinked before they can be used in FoxPro 2.5.  If you purchased a 
library, contact the vendor that originally provided the library for 
information on an updated version.  If you have the original source code 
for the library, just relink the library.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3

I have some existing programs compiled under FoxPro 2.0.  Are they 
compatible?

Answer 3

Programs compiled under FoxPro 2.0, such as .APPs and .FXPs, are not 
compatible with FoxPro 2.5.  To run such programs in FoxPro 2.5, you 
must rebuild them.  For more information about rebuilding FoxPro 2.0 
applications, see the section on Using Files From Other Platforms in the 
Update manual.

New Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

1   FoxPro 2.0 had 25 work areas.  Has this limit been raised in 2.5?
2   Are additional file types supported for direct import into FoxPro?
3   What about additional language enhancements?
4   I have heard a great deal of discussion about cross-platform 
    application development.  Is this capability a reality with 
    FoxPro 2.5?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

FoxPro 2.0 had 25 work areas.  Has this limit been raised in 2.5?

Answer 1

Yes.  Both the Windows version of FoxPro 2.5 and the Extended version
of FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS have 225 work areas.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

Are additional file types supported for direct import into FoxPro?

Answer 2

Yes.  We have added support for importing Microsoft Excel 3.0, Microsoft 
Excel 4.0, Paradox 3.5 and Paradox 4.0 files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3

What about additional language enhancements?

Answer 3

FoxPro 2.5 contains additional generator directives, new system memory 
variables, and new and enhanced commands and functions.  For a complete 
listing of new features in FoxPro 2.5 refer to the Update manual.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4

I have heard a great deal of discussion about cross-platform application 
development.  Is this capability a reality with FoxPro 2.5?

Answer 4

Yes.  FoxPro 2.5 allows you to create and maintain applications that run 
on multiple platforms, such as Windows and MS-DOS, and share data with 
full record locking and other multi-user capabilites.  An application 
that can run on multiple platforms is a cross-platform application.

There are several different approaches to writing cross-platform 
applications in FoxPro.  You can run your MS-DOS applications directly in 
Windows with no changes.  Another option automatically takes your 
application from one platform and transports it to another without any 
additional coding.  Transporting is designed for applications developed 
with the FoxPro power tools: Screen Builder,  Report Writer and Label 
Designer.  The third approach allows you to transport your application 
from one environment to another while maintaining separate interfaces 
for your application on each platform.

For a detailed discussion and examples of the these three options refer 
to the Using Files From Other Platforms section of the Update manual.

Printing Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

1   When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed instead of 
    boxes.  How can I correct this problem?
2   I am using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) system to send 
    data to a report. The data in the report is incorrect; the report 
    prints the same record over and over. How can I correct this problem?
3   Why can't I select the printer driver check box in the Printer Setup 
    Dialog box?
4   I am using a Novell network. I can print by using the Novell CAPTURE 
    command, but the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER command doesn't work. How 
    can I correct this problem?
5   I cannot make the printer drivers work in an executable file. How 
    can I correct this problem?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed instead of boxes.
How can I correct this problem?

Answer 1

In the Printer Setup dialog, specify a printer setup appropriate for 
your printer. If you are already using a printer driver, modify the 
P_CODES database in order to send the proper code for your printer, and 
rebuild the GENPD.APP file. If you are not using a printer driver, send 
the proper escape codes to the printer before you print using the ??? 
command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

I am using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) system to send data to 
a report. The data in the report is incorrect; the report prints the 
same record over and over. How can I correct this problem?

Answer 2

When you created the report, you used alias names in your field 
definitions. To modify the report, simply remove the alias names. For 
example, a field containing CUSTOMER.NAME should be modified to contain 
only NAME.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3

Why can't I select the printer driver check box in the Printer Setup 
dialog?

Answer 3

This problem occurs if you are missing the GENPD.APP file, if the _GENPD 
memory variable is set incorrectly, if the resource file is turned off, 
or if the FOXUSER file is missing, damaged, or marked as read only.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4

I am using a Novell network. I can print by using the Novell CAPTURE 
command, but the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER command doesn't work. How can 
I correct this problem?

Answer 4

If you are receiving the error message "PRINT NOT READY," make sure that 
there are no spaces after the \\SPOOLER section of this command. If the 
printer information does not print until you exit FoxPro, you must issue 
the command SET PRINT TO in order to release the print spooler.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5

I cannot make the printer drivers work in an executable file. How can I 
correct this problem?

Answer 5

Open the project to make sure that the GENPD.APP file is included in the 
project as an application. If it is not included, add GENPD.APP to the 
project as an application.

Note: GENPD.APP is automatically marked as an excluded project element.

Rebuild the project and your executable file. Make sure that you 
distribute the GENPD.APP, FOXUSER.DBF, FOXUSER.FPT, and FOXSWAP.COM 
files with your executable file. If you are distributing an Extended 
Version, also include PROAPI16.EXE in the project.

    through my windows?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

Every time I try to generate a specific screen, I have to add my 
supporting screens to the screen set. How can I avoid this problem?

Answer 1

To save these options, you must create a project and include the screens 
as a screen set.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

When I create a screen set with more than one window, how do I move 
through my windows?

Answer 2

If all the windows in your screen set are READ windows, use the PAGE UP 
key, the PAGE DOWN key, or modify the value of the system memory 
variable _CUROBJ to cycle through the windows of your screen set. If any 
one of the windows in your screen set is not a READ window, such as a 
BROWSE window, then you must press CTRL+F1 to cycle through the screen 
set.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Importing Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1

How do I import a data file into Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS?

Answer 1

To import a data file, use either the IMPORT command or the APPEND FROM 
command. If you are receiving the error message "STRING TOO LONG TO 
FIT," insert a carriage return and a linefeed after each string of data. 
A wide range of file formats is supported. See the Language Reference 
for a complete list of the supported file formats.

2   When I press the CTRL+N key combination in my program to append a 
    new record in the Browse window, I get the musical note instead. How 
    can I correct this problem?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

I modified the structure of my database, but when I use the BROWSE 
command on the file, I don't see the changes. How can I correct this 
problem?

Answer 1

If you cannot see your changes, you are most likely using the BROWSE 
command from the System menu or the View panel, or you are issuing a 
BROWSE LAST or BROWSE PREFERENCE command from the Command window.
To see these structural changes, you must first issue a plain BROWSE
command from the Command window to display the new default version
of the database.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

When I press the CTRL+N key combination in my program to append a new 
record in the Browse window, I get the musical note instead. How can I 
correct this problem?

Answer 2

CTRL+N is a shortcut key combination associated with the System menu. In 
your program, you must issue the command SET SYSMENU ON and/or use a 
BROWSE command instead of the BROWSE NOMENU command.

    alone version.  How can I correct this problem?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1

I have created an application that does not allow me to edit my database 
files.  How can I correct this problem?

Answer 1

Mark your database as excluded in the project, then rebuild your 
application.  You must distribute these files to your end users.  
Including the database in the project automatically makes these files 
read only.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

Why can't I build an executable file from within my project?  The 
options to do so are dimmed and unavailable.

Answer 2

To build an executable file, you must purchase the Microsoft FoxPro 
Distribution Kit and install it in your FoxPro directory.  Prior to 
installing the FoxPro Distribution Kit, make sure that the FoxPro files 
are not marked as read only.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3

When I attempt to build an executable file, I receive the error message 
"LINK COMMAND FAILED." How can I correct this problem?

Answer 3

If you receive this error message, check the following items:

* Make sure that you have enough conventional memory.
* Make sure that you have enough disk space.
* Increase the number of file handles available to FoxPro. To do this, 
  you can increase the FILES setting in the CONFIG.SYS file or increase 
  the FILE HANDLES setting in the SHELL.CFG file.
* Make sure that FoxPro can find your COMMAND.COM file.
* Make sure that the following files are on your path: WLINK8.EXE, 
  PROAPI16.EXE, and FOXSWAP.COM.
* If you are running the Extended Version of FoxPro, make sure that 
  DOSMEM=ON is not on in your CONFIG.FP file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4

My executable file runs correctly under the development version, but I 
receive the error message "FEATURE NOT AVAILABLE" under the stand-alone 
version.  How can I correct this problem?

Answer 4

First, check the "Features Not Available" list in the FoxPro 
Distribution Kit documentation.  Certain features used for development 
are not available in the applications and executables you create.  
If you still encounter problems, it is possible that you are using a 
macro substitution in your program.  You must either eliminate the macro 
substitution or include a program that issues the proper command, but is 
never called, in your project.
